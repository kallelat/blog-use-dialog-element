# How to use new Dialog HTML element with React

Creating a perfect modal or a dialog has been bothering web developers for a long time. Native alert() and confirm() methods are not really suitable due their lack of options and styling. In this article I will try to use the new `<dialog>` element HTML provides, but which is not widely supported yet.

Technologies used:

- React with TypeScript
- Plain CSS files imported to React
- dialog HTML element

## Initial setup and configuration

1. Create a new React app with `npx create-react-app . --template typescript`
2. Start dev server using `npm start`

## Using the new element

TBD

## Summary

TBD

**Feel free to browse the code, if you have any questions or improvement ideas let me know!**
